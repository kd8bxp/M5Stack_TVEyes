# M5Stack TVEyes

Modified code from https://github.com/emilyvelasco/TVeyeball for use with the M5Stack Core, and RCA 13.2 Module (Probably will work with the RCA unit as well).  

TVeyes - The png files, provided needed to be re-encoded for the M5Stack to use, and a 2nd eye was added for display-(and see Notes below) but for the most part this is the code provided by Emily.  

TVeyes2 - Added/Changed how the eyes were display, randomized movements, and randomized blinks.  

TVeyes3 - My attempt to add the eyes looking up and down to the left and up and down to right, (it works, but it's not great)  

Video of it working: https://diode.zone/w/wCgkofnT8VLGwsUzWD3UHc  

## Notes

1) My base code is very much like the code used for my Robot TV display, which means, if you use a M5Go base, as you talk (or loud sounds) - you should see that also displayed on the screen.  

2) This might make a good Halloween display, modified even more to display one large eye in the center of the screen. Just random movements, And scary music playing....
